Run tests
=========

Run locally
-----------

All tests, on default environment: 

    mvn clean test --fail-at-end

To run tests on environemnt add:

    -D environment=prod
    -D environment=sandbox
    -D environment=sandboxpl

To run API tests only add:

    -D cucumber.filter.tags="@api"

To run UI tests only, add:

    -D cucumber.filter.tags="@gui"

To change browser, add:

    -D browser=chrome
    -D browser=firefox

For example, API tests on `prod` environment in chrome:

    mvn clean test -D environment=prod -D cucumber.filter.tags="@api" -D browser=chrome --fail-at-end

Run in Docker
-------------

# Run in standalone browser in Docker: 

    docker pull selenium/standalone-firefox
    docker run -d -p 4444:4444 -p 7900:7900 --shm-size="2g" selenium/standalone-firefox

Check the grid at http://localhost:4444/ui/, see the browser action http://localhost:7900. 

Run tests:
    
     mvn clean test -D environment=prod -D cucumber.filter.tags="@gui" -D grid=http://localhost:4444 --fail-at-end


# Run in Selenium grid in Docker: 

    docker pull selenium/node-firefox
    docker pull selenium/node-chrome 
    docker pull selenium/node-edge

    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml

Check the grid - same as above - at http://localhost:4444/ui/, see the browser action http://localhost:7900.

Run tests - same as above: 

     mvn clean test -D environment=prod -D cucumber.filter.tags="@gui" -D grid=http://localhost:4444 --fail-at-end

To stop: 
    
    Ctrl+C
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yml down


Open report
===========

    open inpost-ui-tests/target/cucumber.html
    open inpost-api-tests/target/cucumber.html


Assumptions:
============

User is in charge of inputting city name in scenario. If they provide it somehow incorrectly, that's how it will be executed within API. 

Ad. Task 1. Test data and desired effect don't match - left failed tests. 

Ad. Task 2. Some data fails tests because it is bad - left failed tests. This is not deterministic - there are times when that bad data is not present on environment (even on prod) ðŸ™ƒ
